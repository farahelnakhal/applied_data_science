        "\n",
        "Typically when a dataset is released to the public, it comes with a **README** file. A README file contains the description, and detailed information about the different folders, files, and fields in the dataset, along with the information about licenses, credits, and citations. It may also contain information on how the data was collected, how many subjects were involved, and so on. A README file is an important part of the dataset as it documents its motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses, and so on. Furthermore, it facilitates better communication between dataset creators and dataset consumers.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this part, you have been given a messy dataset with a clean README file. There is a discrepancy between the dataset we have provided you, and the attached README file as the README file **does not** describe the data. Instead, it describes the *cleaner* version of the dataset that we have hidden from you, and we have no intention of providing that to you. :)\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, we want you to manipulate the messy dataset, and clean it so that it adheres to the README file provided. What this means is merging and/or concatenating the different files, removing redundant or unnecessary fields, dealing with NaNs, defining columns properly, sorting the data, and validating that the final dataset adheres to the README file completely.\n",
        "\n",
        "The messy dataset we have provided corresponds to the **\"Health Trends Dataset\"**. This dataset is collected from two sources: Google search data from **Google Trends**, and official health statistics from **CDC/BRFSS**. The dataset is for two outcome variables: **obesity** and **exercise**.\n",
        "\n",

        "  - **exercise_gender/:** This directory contains 15 files, 1 for each year from 2004 to 2018. Each file contains the state-wise exercise related statistics for the U.S *stratified by gender*.\n",
        "  - **exercise_overall/:** This directory contains 15 files, 1 for each year from 2004 to 2018. Each file contains the *overall* state-wise exercise related statistics for the U.S.\n",
        "  - **obesity_age/:** This directory contains 15 files, 1 for each year from 2004 to 2018. Each file contains the state-wise obesity related statistics for the U.S *stratified by age group*.\n",
        "  - **obesity_gender/:** This directory contains 15 files, 1 for each year from 2004 to 2018. Each file contains the state-wise obesity related statistics for the U.S *stratified by gender*.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **spatial_search_intensity/:** This directory contains 1215 files, 1 for each (year, keywords) pair. Since there are 81 search keywords, and 15 years, this is equal to 1215 files. Each file is named in the **\\<year\\>_spatial_\\<keyword\\>.csv** format.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **temporal_search_intensity/:** This directory contains 81 files, 1 for each keyword. Each file is named in the **2004_2018_temporal_\\<keyword\\>.csv** format.\n",

        "We have also provided you with the paths to the files in each of the 3 directories above in **stats_paths.txt**, **spatial_paths.txt**, **temporal_paths.txt**. This is so that you can read the csv files within each directory using these path files.\n",

        "- You must remove the rows which are empty and uninformative. These would be the empty rows at the end of most of the csv files.\n",
        "- Finally, you should visually inspect to validate that the final dataframes and the output csv files have the required columns and rows sorted as described in the README, and have the required shape. There should be no redundant/extra column(s) or row(s) in the output files, and the column names should match the fields described in the README file.\n",
        "- You should submit the three generated output files with your notebook. We will also use your code to generate these datasets on our own.\n",
        "- Because there are many files to process, your program will take some time (in minutes) to complete its execution. This is primarily because of the `read_csv()` function which is an [I/O bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_bound) process.\n"

        "## B. Does gender affect rating?\n",
        "\n",
        "People perceive things differently based on their identity, culture, age, gender, and values. In [some studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complimentary_language_and_gender), women are known to give and receive more compliments than men. In terms of culture, [Germans are stereotypically perceived as stiff and more critical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypes_of_Germans). Furthermore, there may be conceptual differences: a rating of \"3\" on a particular movie may mean just \"OK\" for one person, and may mean \"Good\" for another. Some people may just be highly optimistic/positive,and never assign a rating of less than \"4\". Some people may just hate certain genres, and like the others. Notice how in such cases ratings are not dependent on the movie (which is the main goal) but on the characteristics/traits of the users.\n",
        "\n",
        "In data, these issues are sometimes known as *annotator biases* or *rater biases*, and the characteristics of people that define these biases are known as *covariates*. In an ideal case, (movie) ratings should be independent of these biases. But that is rarely the case. Characterizing and understanding these differences is a challenging problem. However, we generally like to account for these differences and control for them: accounting/normalizing for them when creating a machine learning model, and controlling for them when studying relationships between variables .\n",
        "Age and gender are classic covariates. That is the reason why you would notice that most datasets like *MovieLens* tend to provide information about their raters'/subjects' gender, age, location, and so on. Controlling for such *covariates/confounders* is beyond the scope of this course.\n",
        "\n",
        "That said, in this task, we would like to do two very simple experiments to just inspect if there are biases introduced by gender in the dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) For each **movie title**, we would like to get mean ratings per gender; and then compute the absolute difference in mean ratings. While this by itself is not enough, if by visual inspection most movies have higher difference in mean ratings, that could signal towards gender bias;\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) Regardless of the movie, for each **genre** (except the `unknown` genre), we would also like to compute the mean ratings per gender, and then compute the absolute difference in mean ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "But how would you group movies by genre when one movie can have multiple genres, and especially **different number** of genres. Well, that is exactly why we made you do Part A to sort of group different combinations of genres to create new ones :-).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the end, we want two DataFrames:\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) one named `df_movie_gender` with the following columns:\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   **movie_title**: this is the title of the movie\n",
        "  *   **difference in average ratings**: this is the absolute difference in average ratings of male and female raters for each movie\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) second named `df_genre_gender` with the following columns:\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   **genre**: this is the name of the genre (or a composite genre)\n",
        "  *   **difference in average ratings**: this is the absolute difference in average ratings of male and female raters for each genre\n",
        "\n",
        "Both of your dataframes should be sorted by the column **difference in average ratings** in descending order."
